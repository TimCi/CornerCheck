# CornerCheck

## The problem
The city MÃ¼nster, Germany has a vivid culture of people meeting at a kiosk. Here they drink, talk and have a great time together. This is called "cornering". But not everybody has a great time while the people enjoy "cornering". Some neighbours are bothered by the noise caused by the people. Therefore the city authority banned people from cornering by fining the kiosk owners, if they allow people to "corner".
This is a big problem for street culture and needs a immediate response. Here "CornerCheck" comes into action. Our Application provides tools to measure the noise created by the people and visualizes it in three different ways: by color, by emotion and by facts. 
It also provides direct situational statistics for all the people cornering (last 15min) to change their behavior. In addition to that we provide summary statistics for the kiosk owner and/or the city authority, to the saisonalities and other patterns in the noise data.

The Folders contain the following files:
- **src**: all source code of the apllication
- **reports**: all reports created in the span of the project. Due to the conception of the university course this repository is created for, these files will be in german.
- **wiki**: all documentation and knowledge gathered in the span of this project

### Usage of custom libraries
Currently, all custom libraries for our application are managed in this repository. To make these libraries accesible in your local Arduino IDE you have to include the libraries in your "libraries" folder inside the directory "Arduino15".
